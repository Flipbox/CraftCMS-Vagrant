# CraftCMS-Vagrant
A collection of Vagrant files that builds a local development environment for you to test and develop on CraftCMS quickly.

#Goal of this repo
The Goal of this repo is to provide an easy-to-use a vagrant configuration so you can quickly get CraftCMS up and running with all of the necessary PHP, Apache, and MySQL dependencies.
This repo aims to be as up-to-date as possible so if you don't have the latest installs of certain software, you may have issues. If you find an 
issue with anything please submit a pull request or a Github issue.

Lastly, we've tried to keep this as secure as possible but please **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**.
